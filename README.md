Follow these steps to set up and run the hand gesture recognition system:

how to run code:
1. **Set Up Project Directory**
   - Create a directory structure as follows:
   ```
   gesture_recognition/
   ├── data/
   ├── models/
   ├── scripts/
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── README.md
   ```

2. **Install Required Packages**
   - Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Collect Data**
   - Run the data collection script to capture images of hand gestures:
   ```bash
   python scripts/collect_data.py
   ```

4. **Preprocess Data**
   - Preprocess the collected images to prepare them for training:
   ```bash
   python scripts/preprocess_data.py
   ```

5. **Train the Model**
   - Train the gesture recognition model using the preprocessed data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/train_model.py
   ```

6. **Run Real-Time Recognition**
   - Start the real-time gesture recognition system:
   ```bash
   python scripts/real_time_recognition.py
   ```

 Additional Notes
- Ensure your webcam is connected and accessible.
- Press 'q' to exit the real-time recognition window.
- Modify scripts as needed to add custom features or improve functionality.
- problem statement:
-  In the era of increasing reliance on touchless interaction, the need for intuitive human-computer interfaces is paramount. This project aims to develop a real-time hand gesture recognition system using a web camera and a custom-trained image classification model. The system will recognize and classify various hand gestures, such as "thumbs up," "thumbs down," "peace sign," and "open palm," enabling seamless interaction without physical contact.

The objectives include:

1. **Data Collection**: Create a comprehensive dataset by capturing at least 200-300 images per gesture under diverse lighting conditions and hand positions, organized into distinct folders for each gesture category.
  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the collected images to enhance model performance, including resizing, normalization, and optional background isolation using techniques like edge detection with OpenCV.

3. **Model Implementation**: Implement a robust Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or leverage transfer learning using a pre-trained model such as MobileNet or VGG16, training it on the collected dataset for effective gesture classification.

4. **Real-time Gesture Recognition**: Utilize OpenCV to establish a live video feed from the web camera, applying the trained model to predict gestures in real time, and displaying the results directly on the video stream.

5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using a validation set, calculating accuracy, precision, and recall metrics, along with visualizing training and validation accuracy/loss curves.

6. **Custom Features**: Introduce additional functionalities, such as tracking gestures over time, counting occurrences, and enabling user interactions through specific gestures (e.g., raising a hand to pause a video).

By addressing these components, the project seeks to create an effective and user-friendly hand gesture recognition system that can enhance interactive experiences across various applications, including gaming, remote control, and accessibility tools.
